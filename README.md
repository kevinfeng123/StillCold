## To Do List:
- [ ] Write informative comments for each chosen method in Deque interface
- [ ] Choose a data structure for deque testing and implementation
- [ ] Write deque implementation, methods in QQKachoo:
     - ```void addFirst( Card C ); ```
     - ```void addLast( Card C ); ```
     - ```Card pollFirst(); ```
     - ```Card pollLast(); ```
     - ```Card peekFirst(); ```
     - ```Card peekLast(); ```
     - ```boolean isEmpty(); ```

- [ ] Create a driver for testing QQKachoo
- [ ] Update README.md with method selections and rationale for choosing said data structure

## Development Plan:
1. Select methods for our local Deque interface based on queue and deque Java API entries
2. Write local Deque interface with comments
3. Choose a data structure for deque testing and implementation
4. Write deque implementation, methods in QQKachoo
5. Create a driver for testing QQKachoo
6. Update README.md with method selections and rationale for choosing said data structure
