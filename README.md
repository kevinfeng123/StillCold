## To Do List:
* Choose a data structure for deque testing and implementation
* Write deque implementation, methods in QQKachoo
 - ```void addFirst( Card C ); ```
 - ```void addLast( Card C ); ```
 - ```Card pollFirst(); ```
 - ```Card pollLast(); ```
 - ```Card peekFirst(); ```
 - ```Card peekLast(); ```
 - ```boolean isEmpty(); ```


* Create a driver for testing QQKachoo
* Update README.md with method selections and rationale for choosing said data structure

## Development Plan:
1. Choose a data structure for deque testing and implementation
2. Write deque implementation, methods in QQKachoo
3. Create a driver for testing QQKachoo
4. Update README.md with method selections and rationale for choosing said data structure
